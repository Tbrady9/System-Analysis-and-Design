# System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project was a project for Liam from DriverPass. Liam wanted an online training system that would offer a variety of online practice tests as well as real world driving practice with an instructor.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I believe that I worked hard on creating easily readable UML diagrams that remained clutter free and gave clear direction.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

In an attempt to keep everything free of clutter, I think I may have skipped over a customer requirement or two. I recognize that capturing all requirements is crucial to great planning so, if I were able to go back, I would spend more time trying to find a way to keep the diagrams as readable as possible while accurately representing all requirements.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

We held a meeting with the customer to go over requirements. Those requirements were documented and planned out for the system. This is crucial because the customer is the one requesting the system. Spening time developing a system that does not fit the needs of the customer is a waste of everyone's time as it helps nobody. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

Before this course, my approach to development was to start coding and, more or less, figure it out as I go. This course has helped show me that planning is extremely important for the success of the software. Requirements need to be met as efficiently as possible and planning can help ensure that happens.
